# Ekart Backend

This project was developed using Spring Boot version 3.1.2, a framework for building Java-based microservices.

## Development server

To run the backend server, you can use your preferred IDE or build tool. After starting the server, the endpoints will be available at `http://localhost:9090/`. The server will automatically handle incoming requests and responses.

## Code scaffolding

Spring Boot follows a convention-over-configuration approach, so you don't need to scaffold components manually. It will automatically scan for components, services, controllers, and more as long as they are in the appropriate package structure.

## Build

To build the project, you can use the build tools provided by Spring Boot or your chosen build automation tool. The built artifacts and compiled code will be generated accordingly.

## Running unit tests

You can create and run unit tests for your microservices using testing frameworks such as JUnit , TestNG or Mockito. These tests will help ensure the functionality of individual components.

## Running integration tests

Spring Boot supports integration testing. You can create tests that interact with your microservices, their APIs, and the underlying data. This helps ensure that different parts of your microservices work together correctly.
